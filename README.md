# Personal Projects
Project 1 
- This is an NHL data analysis process that allows a user to see four different statastics leaders for the National Hockey Leauge. These four options include top goal scorers, goalies with the highest save percentage, players with the most hits, and players with the highest amount of penalty minutes. All of this data is gathered from two csv files from the beginning of the 2023-24 season which are required to run this code and have been attached as a file here in Github (nhl-stats_1, nhl-stats_2).

Project 2 
- This is a calendar assistant that allows the user to record and input events for them to remember. The full options of this code prompts the user to add an event, delete an event, and list the events for a date. Users interact with these program options by using the text-based menu interface, which prompts the user to choose from one of the options. 

Project 3 
- This is a script that is able to handle and process image data that is in JSON format. Within this code, the constants and functions are defined which allow the code to complete things like file handling, data reading, as well as analysis. Through the function of main, the user can choose from the following options, displaying categories, finding images by category, and analyzing the word frequency in the captions. 

#Group Projects 
Organization Project 
- This is a final group project that established our knowledge of understanding how an organization works at each layer. The goal of this project was to build an organizational plan for a business and to increase our project management skills. Our team decided on creating an medical AI organization which can be viewed through the **Final Organization Slides pptx** and the summary doc which explains the slides in detail (**335 Final Project Slides Summary**).

Sql Team Project 
- This was a team project that required us to design and build a non-trivial relational database. As a team we chose an information domain which was a detailed excel sheet of accidents and information about them (**accidents_table csv**). Then we had to create projected entities and assign data attributes, followed by building a logical design through normalization. Then we made a physical database that implemented the logical design including queries and views that showcase the capabilities of the data base (**team_4_collisions_backup.sql, team_4_collisions_queries.sql**). Lastly, we had to create a final report which was a report covering the overall database development process: the challenges faced, the solutions developed for those challenges, the lessons learned, the strengths and limitations of the database, possible future improvements, and other important aspects of the project and the database. (**INST 327 - Final Project Submission**).
