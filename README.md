Project 1 
- This is an NHL data analysis process that allows a user to see four different statastics leaders for the National Hockey Leauge. These four options include top goal scorers, goalies with the highest save percentage, players with the most hits, and players with the highest amount of penalty minutes. All of this data is gathered from two csv files from the beginning of the 2023-24 season which are required to run this code and have been attached as a file here in Github (nhl-stats_1, nhl-stats_2).

Project 2 
- This is a calendar assistant that allows the user to record and input events for them to remember. The full options of this code prompts the user to add an event, delete an event, and list the events for a date. Users interact with these program options by using the text-based menu interface, which prompts the user to choose from one of the options. 

Project 3 
- This is a script that is able to handle and process image data that is in JSON format. Within this code, the constants and functions are defined which allow the code to complete things like file handling, data reading, as well as analysis. Through the function of main, the user can choose from the following options, displaying categories, finding images by category, and analyzing the word frequency in the captions.
